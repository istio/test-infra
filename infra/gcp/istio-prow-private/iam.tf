# Because private project is only for trusted individuals, we do not use fine-scoped service accounts.
# Instead, everything runs as one service account with access to what we need.
# Granted AR access in ar.tf.
# RBE is not used in private cluster, so no permission needed there.
# DockerHub, Grafana, and GitHub tokens are not used, so no secret access needed.
